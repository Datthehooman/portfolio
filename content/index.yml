            I specialize in frontend development with Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and TypeScript. My stack includes HTML5, CSS3, SCSS/SASS, TailwindCSS, UnoCSS, and Bootstrap5.

            My primary framework is Vue.js and its ecosystem — Pinia, Vue-router, Vuex, Nuxt, Nuxt UI, and Element UI. I've built multiple production applications with Nuxt.js including SSR (Server-Side Rendering) applications.

            I studied Backend Web Development at FPT Polytechnic College (2023–2025) with a GPA of 9/10.
