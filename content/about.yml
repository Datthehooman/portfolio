  Hi, I'm **Bùi Nguyên Đạt**, an ambitious Frontend Developer based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I'm passionate about working with the latest technologies on challenging and diverse projects, constantly improving myself both physically and mentally.

  My journey in tech has equipped me with strong expertise in Vue, Nuxt, TypeScript, and modern CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS and UnoCSS. I've gained hands-on experience across multiple companies, from early-stage internships at Bigin and Pihome to my current role as a Frontend Developer at FPT Polytechnic. If I had to define myself in one sentence, I'd say I'm a family person, movie nerd, bowling enthusiast, game fanatic, and tech-obsessed developer!

  ### My Development Philosophy

  My development philosophy is rooted in **clean code** and **user-centric design**. I believe great web experiences are built on a foundation of semantic HTML, efficient JavaScript, and thoughtful UX. I leverage modern frameworks like Vue.js and Nuxt to create responsive, performant applications that solve real user problems.

  I'm committed to staying current with the web development landscape, regularly learning new tools and best practices. Whether I'm building component libraries or full-stack applications, my focus is on creating maintainable, scalable solutions that provide genuine value to users.

  ### What Drives Me

  What keeps me excited about this work is the constant learning and the challenge of translating complex ideas into simple, elegant solutions. There's nothing more rewarding than seeing a feature go live and knowing it's making users' digital interactions easier or more enjoyable.

  ### Beyond the Screen

  When I'm not coding, you might find me enjoying movies, practicing my bowling skills, playing the latest games, or exploring new tech innovations. I pride myself on being a great communicator, a supportive team player, and someone who handles high-stress situations with ease.
